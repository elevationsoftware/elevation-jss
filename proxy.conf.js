/*
  When the app runs in disconnected mode, and Sitecore is not present, we need to give
  the app copies of the Sitecore APIs it depends on (layout service, dictionary service, content service)
  to talk to so that the app can run using the locally defined disconnected data.

  This is accomplished by spinning up a small Express server that mocks the APIs, and then
  telling angular-cli to proxy requests to the API paths to this express instance.

  Customizing these fake services may be required if your app has advanced data requirements,
  or has other backend services that it requires. See the angular advanced sample for examples
  of doing this, as well as how to proxy the dictionary and content services.
